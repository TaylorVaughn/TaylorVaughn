- 👋 Hi, I’m @TaylorVaughn
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, books, music, and art!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create game art, develop games using Unreal and Unity, as well as learning C++ so I can try writing games from scratch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games. I'm a decent coder, an amateur artist, and terrific author.
- 📫 How to reach me: taylorvaughn.dev@gmail.com
